//
// NOTE: When building with SDL2 in Windows,
// main() must have "full" signature,
// i.e. 'int main (int argc, char* agrv[])'
// or you'll get "undefined reference to SDLmain"
// because SDL wraps main() under the hood,
// so the signature must match.
// By the way, IINM, it should be exactly 'char* argv[]',
// not 'char**' or anything.
//
// Also you need to manually "Add" -> "File" in "Projects" tab of QT Creator's
// cmake config window called SDL2_LIBRARY and point it to libSDL2.dll.a file.
//
// Or, as it seems nowadays, there is an 'sdl2-config.cmake' provided with
// development version of SDL2, so it will be picked up by cmake automatically
// and it will tell you what to do.
//
// The only problem I had is that I had to manually specify unconfigured
// cmake variables in QT Creator's "Projects" tab
// (i.e. SDL2_LIBRARY, SDL2_DIR and so on).
// Apparently cmake won't add them into project configuration as unset variables,
// so I had to look into the cmake output log to see what variable I need to add
// and what kind of (i.e. directory for SDL2_DIR, file for SDL2_LIBRARY etc).
//
// Well, anyway, I don't think it will be much of a problem,
// since even such simpleminded person such as myself managed to figure it out.
// You'll figure it out too.
//
// In Linux everything should configure and build out of the box,
// provided you have distro specific ncurses-dev / SDL2-dev
// packages installed.
